#Exercise 1: Pascal’s Triangle
#The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a function that computes the elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.
#Do this exercise by implementing the pascal function in Main.scala, which takes a column c and a row r, counting from 0 and returns the number at that spot in the triangle. For example, pascal(0,2)=1, pascal(1,2)=2 and pascal(1,3)=3.

def pascal(c:Int,r:Int):Int = {if (c==0 || c== r) 1 else (pascal(c-1,r-1)+pascal(c,r-1))}
